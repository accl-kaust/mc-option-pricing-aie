# A Dataflow Overlay for Monte Carlo Multi-Asset Option Pricing on AMD Versal AI Engines [ISC'25]

This project enables the multi-asset option pricing (a quantitative finance application). It uses a Monte-Carlo simulation for resolution. It consists of a scalable design of a stream dataflow overlay specifically tailored for the AMD AI Engines and is implemented on AMD Versal ACAP VCK5000 SoC.
